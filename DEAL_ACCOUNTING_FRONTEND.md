## Interface Sections

### 1. **–°–æ–∑–¥–∞—Ç—å –°–¥–µ–ª–∫—É** (Create Deal)

Create new deals with automatic accounting integration:

**Form Fields:**

- **–¢–∏–ø –°–¥–µ–ª–∫–∏** (Deal Type): Service (–ê–í–†) or Product (–Ω–∞–∫–ª–∞–¥–Ω–∞—è)

- **–°—É–º–º–∞** (Amount): Deal amount in KZT
- **–û–ø–∏—Å–∞–Ω–∏–µ** (Description): Optional deal description

**Automatic Processing:**

- Creates journal entry: –î—Ç 1121 (Trade Receivables) - –ö—Ç 4110 (Sales Revenue)
- Generates appropriate document (–ê–í–† for services, –Ω–∞–∫–ª–∞–¥–Ω–∞—è for products)
- Sets deal status to 'active'

### 2. **–°–ø–∏—Å–æ–∫ –°–¥–µ–ª–æ–∫** (Deal List)

View and manage all created deals:

**Display Information:**

- Counterparty name with status badges

- Total amount and paid amount
- Deal status (Draft/Active/Completed/Cancelled)

**Interaction:**

- Click to select deal for further operations
- Visual selection feedback
- Real-time balance updates

### 3. **–ü–ª–∞—Ç–µ–∂–∏** (Payments)

Record payments against selected deals:

**Payment Form:**

- **–û–ø–∏—Å–∞–Ω–∏–µ** (Description): Payment description

**Selected Deal Display:**

- Deal details with remaining balance
- Visual confirmation of selected deal

**Automatic Processing:**

- üî¥ –ü–µ—Ä–µ–ø–ª–∞—Ç–∞ (Overpaid): Payments exceed deal amount
- üü° –ù–µ–¥–æ–ø–ª–∞—Ç–∞ (Underpaid): Payments less than deal amount

**Unmatched Entries:**

- Highlights journal entries that don't match expected patterns
- Visual warning for accounting discrepancies

**Document Generation:**

- Generate documents for existing deals
- Support for both –ê–í–† and –Ω–∞–∫–ª–∞–¥–Ω–∞—è document types

## Technical Implementation

### **State Management**

```typescript
// Core state
const [deals, setDeals] = useState<Deal[]>([])
const [selectedDeal, setSelectedDeal] = useState<Deal | null>(null)
const [balanceInfo, setBalanceInfo] = useState<BalanceResponse | null>(null)
const [reconciliationReport, setReconciliationReport] = useState<ReconciliationReport | null>(null)

// Form state
const [dealForm, setDealForm] = useState({...})
const [paymentForm, setPaymentForm] = useState({...})
```

### **API Integration**

```typescript
// Deal creation
const response = await api.post<DealResponse>('/deals/with-accounting', {...})

// Payment recording
const response = await api.post<PaymentResponse>(`/deals/${dealId}/payments`, {...})

// Balance retrieval
const response = await api.get<BalanceResponse>(`/deals/${dealId}/balance`)

// Reconciliation report
const response = await api.get<ReconciliationReport>(`/deals/${dealId}/reconciliation`)
```

### **Error Handling**
